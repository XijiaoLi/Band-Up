# Band-Up
BandUp is a serverless, microservice-driven application that we envision would cater seamlessly to 5,000 monthly active users.

The application leverages the Platform as a Service (PaaS) offered by core AWS services, such as using Lambda Function as serverless compute, Dynamo DB as NoSQL document database, S3 bucket to host the website, etc. We also utilize some of the innovative offerings from AWS like Rekognition, Lex, Transcribe and Elastic search for some of our functionalities.

BandUp provides most of the features that one would expect from a social application like user management, secured access to assets and personal information, interactions with the user interface and notifications on events. What is more, BandUp is accompanied by useful aggregate analytics on the usage patterns that can be efficiently viewed by the administrators of the application using interactive visualisations.
